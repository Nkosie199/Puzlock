        Hence, we compute the accessibility of voxels in Ri and reduce the number of candidates to ten by the following equally-weighted criteria: 
        (i) smaller accessibility value; and 
        (ii) shorter distance to the furthest-away voxel in Ri along d>i+1, see Figure 11(c) 
        for examples: an initial Pi+1 formed by C2 will contain more voxels as compared to C1 because of a longer shortest path determined by step 2 below. 
        Hence, the second criteria helps reduce the number of voxels that are required to form an initial Pi+1. 
        Note that we attempt to use fewer voxels (in early steps) to construct an initial Pi+1 because this allows us to have more flexibility when expanding the puzzle piece in step 3. */

        (i) from each candidate, we identify all voxels in Ri along d>i+1 (see the orange voxels in Figure 11(d)) 
        since these voxels must be taken to Pi+1 to make the candidate removable along d>i+1; 
        (ii) we determine a shortest path to connect the candidate to these identified voxels (Figure 11(e)), and 
        (iii) we locate also any additional voxel required to mobilize the shortest path towards d>i+1 (Figure 11(f)). 
        To choose among the candidates, we sum the accessibility of all the voxels involved in each candidate path (blue voxels in Figure 11(f)),

        (i) Pi+1 is immobilized in the presence of Ri+1 and Pi, and (ii) it cannot co-move with Pi. 
        For this, we perform a mobility check for each of the five directions to see if Pi+1 is blocked or not. 
        Note that the mobility check of Pi+1 along any direction d> is done by checking if any voxel from Pi or Ri+1 contacts Pi+1 along d>. 
        If this is true, Pi+1 is immobilized to move along d>.

        we have to perform the mobility check on Pi+1 in the absence of Pi for this particular direction. 
        Lastly, note further that the anchor voxel strategy in Section 5.1 can also be applied here.
